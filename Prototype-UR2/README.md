# smarthome.iot / User Research #2 Prototype

This prototype will support of our next round of user research, in which we are investigating 1:1 communication with a simple physical device, built around the Particle "Photon" board.

### Overview

The device connects over Wifi to Particle's cloud service where "messages" are exchanged between an identical "paired" device held by a friend. The device has a single button, and clicking/double-clicking/long-clicking on one results in a different LED animation on the other.

### Bill of Materials

Vendor links are just a suggestion. You may want to adjust based on what you can get hold of locally, quantity etc. Our code is currently specific to the Photon board (but could be ported to other similar platforms.)

### Connecting to WiFi

* Make sure your WiFi is turned on. If phone: Tap Home > Settings > WiFi on your phone. If computer: do tap WiFi icon on your computer to choose a WiFi network.

* Press SETUP button on your device for 3 seconds. This will put your device in Listening Mode and your device should begin blinking dark blue. When your device is in Listening Mode, it is waiting for you to connect it to WiFi.

* Go to Home > Settings > Wifi and change to the Photon-XXXX network.

* After connected to Photon-XXXX network, open browser and enter this URL http://192.168.0.1/index.html in a browser window.

* Click the Scan button. A list of WiFi networks will show.

* Press the option button for your home WiFi network.

* Enter your home WiFi password in the Password field. Then click Connect button. Your device should blink green to let you know itâ€™s trying to connect to the internet. An alert will show with help instruction in case you entered wrong password. Press OK.

* Give your device a few seconds to connect and start blinking light blue. When it is blinking light blue, your device is happily connected to the Internet!
