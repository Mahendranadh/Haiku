# smarthome.iot / User Research #2 Prototype

This prototype will support of our next round of user research, in which we are investigating 1:1 communication with a simple physical device, built around the Particle "Photon" board.

### Overview

The device connects over Wifi to Particle's cloud service where "messages" are exchanged between an identical "paired" device held by a friend. The device has a single button, and clicking/double-clicking/long-clicking on one results in a different LED animation on the other.

### Bill of Materials

Vendor links are just a suggestion. You may want to adjust based on what you can get hold of locally, quantity etc. Our code is currently specific to the Photon board (but could be ported to other similar platforms.)
